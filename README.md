## Overview
This project involves setting up a home lab environment using VirtualBox to simulate a small Active Directory infrastructure with two Windows 10 machines, a Kali Linux machine for penetration testing, and a Splunk machine for telemetry and log analysis. The environment was configured to simulate security attacks on an Active Directory domain, collect telemetry data, and analyze potential vulnerabilities.

## Objective

The lab aims to provide a hands-on experience in setting up a virtualized environment for cybersecurity testing and exploration. Participants will create and configure multiple virtual machines (VMs) running Windows 10, Kali Linux, Windows Server, and Ubuntu Server. The lab focuses on teaching essential skills such as network configuration, security tool installation (e.g., Splunk, Sysmon), endpoint monitoring, and conducting security tests (including brute force attacks with Crowbar). Additional objectives include joining Windows machines to an Active Directory domain, enabling Remote Desktop, and automating tasks using PowerShell scripting. Overall, the lab offers practical exposure to cybersecurity concepts, tools, and techniques in a controlled, safe environment.

**Tools:**
- Orac
- Crowbar: For Brute Force Attack.
- Atomic Red Team: For simulating attack techniques via PowerShell.
- Sysmon: For system monitoring.
- Splunk Universal Forwarder: For log forwarding.
- VirtualBox: For virtualization.
